## UK Web Archive Open Data: 'big data' for 'small histories' 

This is a work in progress project making use of [UK Web Archive Open Data](http://data.webarchive.org.uk/opendata/) to demonstrate how some big data style approaches can be used for research questions about particular institutions. I am still learning Python so there are probably mistakes. I will keep updating this project by outlining new techniques and approaches and by tidying the code.
